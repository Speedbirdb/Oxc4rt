Daily Development Report - December 19, 2024

Project: Oxc4rt Authentication System
Developer: Kaan
Date: December 19, 2024
Session: Backend Implementation

Work Completed Today

Database Schema Fixes
- Fixed User schema duplicate timestamps configuration
- Removed redundant timestamps from codeExpiry field
- Schema now properly configured with single timestamps setting

Auth Controller Implementation
- Fixed syntax errors in constructor
- Added proper HTTP decorators import
- Implemented basic signup endpoint structure
- Implemented basic verify endpoint structure
- Controller now compiles without errors

User Service Implementation
- Added proper constructor with dependency injection
- Implemented create method for user registration
- Implemented findByEmail method for user lookup
- Implemented updateVerificationCode method for verification flow
- Added proper TypeScript typing with User model
- Added async/await pattern for database operations

Current System Status

Completed Components
- User Schema: Complete and functional
- Database Connection: Working MongoDB integration
- User Service: Core methods implemented
- Auth Controller: Basic structure with endpoints
- User Module: Properly configured with schema registration

In Progress Components
- Auth Service: Structure exists but needs implementation
- Email Service: Module created but empty
- Frontend integration: Components exist but not connected to backend

Pending Components
- Auth Service business logic implementation
- Email Service SMTP configuration
- Password hashing implementation
- API testing and validation
- Frontend to backend connection

Technical Implementation Details

User Service Methods
- create(): Creates new user in database
- findByEmail(): Retrieves user by email address
- updateVerificationCode(): Updates verification code for user

Auth Controller Endpoints
- POST /auth/signup: User registration endpoint
- POST /auth/verify: Email verification endpoint

Database Operations
- Proper Mongoose model injection
- TypeScript typing for database operations
- Promise-based async operations

Issues Resolved
- Auth Controller syntax errors preventing compilation
- User Service empty method implementations
- Database schema configuration conflicts

Next Priority Tasks

Immediate (Next Session)
- Implement Auth Service business logic
- Connect Auth Controller to User Service
- Add password hashing to User Service
- Create Email Service implementation

Short Term
- Add error handling to all services
- Implement remaining auth endpoints (signin, resend)
- Test API endpoints with Postman
- Configure email service provider

Medium Term
- Connect Angular frontend to backend APIs
- Implement frontend authentication state management
- Add comprehensive error handling
- End to end testing

Development Notes
- Backend foundation is now solid with working database operations
- API endpoints are ready for business logic implementation
- Next session should focus on Auth Service to connect all components
- Email service configuration will require SMTP provider setup

Code Quality Status
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Proper dependency injection implemented
- Database operations follow async/await patterns
- Type safety maintained throughout codebase

Time Allocation
- Schema fixes: 15 minutes
- Auth Controller implementation: 30 minutes  
- User Service implementation: 45 minutes
- Testing and validation: 15 minutes
- Total session time: 1 hour 45 minutes

Progress Metrics
- Backend completion: 75% (up from 70%)
- API structure: 60% complete
- Database layer: 90% complete
- Service layer: 50% complete
