Backend Fixes Applied - December 19, 2024

TypeScript Errors Fixed:

1. User Service Return Types
   - Changed findByEmail return type to Promise<User | null>
   - Changed updateVerificationCode return type to Promise<User | null>
   - Fixed MongoDB null return handling

2. Auth Service Improvements
   - Fixed null handling in verifyCode method
   - Separated null checks for better error messages
   - Added signin method implementation
   - Cleaned up code formatting

3. Auth Controller Enhancement
   - Added signin endpoint POST /auth/signin
   - All endpoints now properly connected to Auth Service

4. Email Service Integration
   - Auth Service now uses EmailService.generateVerificationCode()
   - Email sending integrated into signup flow
   - Removed duplicate code generation method

Current Backend Status:

Working Endpoints:
- POST /auth/signup - Creates user and sends verification email
- POST /auth/verify - Validates verification codes
- POST /auth/signin - User authentication (password check pending)

Next Steps Required:
1. Install bcrypt for password hashing
2. Add password hashing to User Service
3. Add password comparison to Auth Service signin
4. Test all endpoints with Postman
5. Add user verification status update

Testing Instructions:
1. Start MongoDB: mongod
2. Start NestJS: cd store && npm run start:dev
3. Test endpoints with Postman at http://localhost:3000

All TypeScript compilation errors resolved.
Backend foundation complete and ready for testing.
